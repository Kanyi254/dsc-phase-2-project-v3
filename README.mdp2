## COMPANY RESEARCH INTO THE MOVIE INDUSTRY

**Business Understanding**
Your company now sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio,
but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. 
You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of your company's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.




The correlation coefficient is -0.01, indicating a very weak negative correlation. This means that as the runtime increases,the average rating slightly decreases, 
but the relationship is almost negligible. In simpler terms, the length of runtime has almost no impact on the average rating.The data points are mostly clustered near the origin,
with one outlier far along the horizontal axis, suggesting that most items have short runtimes and similar ratings, with very few exceptions. Below is the graph that shows the above;



***Conclusion***
* The budget doesn't guarantee a higher revenue. This shows us wee need to be careful in how much we add to the budget because we can get serious losses.

* Runtime doesn't affect the ratings of the movie, people are more immersed with the content not he time it takes away

* Documentary, Drama and Biography are the genres with the highest average ratings. This means also that a lot of the voters enjoy watching this kind of shows

***Recommendations***
* Focus on movies with a runtime of 120 minutes or more, as they are more likely to have a longer runtime and thus more potential for a higher rating.

* Be sure to choose a movie with a budget of at least $100 million, as this will give you a good starting point for your movie.

* Keep a watch on the popularity of your movie (number of votes), as it can help you make sure it is a hit.

* Be sure to choose a movie with a genre that is not too popular (like drama, comedy, or romance), as it will make your movie more appealing to a wider audience. A well balanced movie can have a great success.
